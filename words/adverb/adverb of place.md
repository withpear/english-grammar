# Adverbs of Place
* 不能修饰副词和形容词，
* 除了形容词‘bound’，只有表示direction的地点副词才可以和bound一起使用。例如： homeward bound，bound south
，bound for home

## Position
* 直接出现在主动词（不及物）后面
• “We were walking north.”
           -------        intransitive verb
                   -----  adverb of place

* 放在动词（及物）宾语后面
• “He kicked the ball into the field.” 
      ------                            transitive verb  
             --------                   verb’s object  
                      ----              adverb of place  

* ‘here’与‘there’常被放在开头用于强调location或表示惊叹
